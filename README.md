# What is this

Example showcasing the use of `_app.js` to create a common layout, and how to update that layout with the Context API.

Navigate to either `/` or `/about`, and you will see that the page title changes, and that both pages contain a navbar even though there's nothing in `pages/index.js` or `pages/about.js` which define this navbar.

Note: This isn't the prettiest example (it has no CSS).

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
